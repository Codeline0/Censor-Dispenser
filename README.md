Censor Dispenser

Used to censor sensitive information from texts.

Project instructions:

- Write a function that can censor a specific word or phrase from a body of text, and then return the text from email_one.
- Write a function that can censor not just a specific word or phrase from a body of text, but a whole list of words and phrases, and then return the text from email_two.
- Write a function that can censor any occurance of a word from the “negative words” list after any “negative” word has occurred twice, as well as censoring everything from the list from the previous step as well and use it to censor email_three.
- Write a function that censors not only all of the words from the negative_words and proprietary_terms lists, but also censor any words in email_four that come before AND after a term from those two lists.

This repository includes the complete code "Censor Dispenser.py" , the uncensored, and the censored emails.
