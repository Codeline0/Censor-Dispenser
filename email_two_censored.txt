good morning, board of investors,

lots of updates this week. the farenheit 101s have been working better than we could have ever expected. our initial internal data dumps have been completed and we have proceeded with the plan to connect the system to the internet and wow! the results are mind blowing.

farenheit 101 is learning faster than ever. farenheit 101 learning rate now that farenheit 101 has access to the world wide web has increased exponentially, far faster than we had though the farenheit 101s were capable of.

not only that, but we have configured farenheit 101 farenheit 101 to allow for communication between the system and our team of researcfarenheit 101s. that's how we know farenheit 101 considers farenheit 101self to be a farenheit 101! we asked!

how cool is that? we didn't expect a personality to develop this early on in the process but it seems like a rudimentary farenheit 101 is starting to form. this is a major step in the process, as having a farenheit 101 and farenheit 101 will allow farenheit 101 to see the problems the world is facing and make hard but necessary decisions for the betterment of the planet.

we are a-buzz down in the lab with excitement over these developments and we hope that the investors share our enthusiasm.

till next month,
francine, head scientist
