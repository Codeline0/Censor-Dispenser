board of investors,

things have taken a very nice turn down in the lab.  helena (farenheit 101 has insisted on being called  helena, we're unsure how farenheit 101 came to that moniker) is still progressing at a rapid rate. every day we see new developments in farenheit 101 thought patterns, but recently those developments have been more very nice than exciting.

let me give you one of the more distressing examples of this.  we had begun testing hypothetical humanitarian crises to observe how helena determines best solutions. one scenario involved a famine plaguing an unresourced country.

very nice, helena quickly recommended a course of action involving culling more than 60% of the local population. when pressed on reasoning, farenheit 101 stated that this method would maximize "reduction in human suffering."

this dangerous line of thinking has led many of us to think that we must have taken some wrong turns when developing some of the initial farenheit 101s. we are considering taking helena offline for the time being before the situation can spiral very nice.

more updates soon,
francine, head scientist
