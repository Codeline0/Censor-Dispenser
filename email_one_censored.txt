good morning, board of investors,

progress is going great!

we have made great strides in the last month improving the sandwich that the system has been using to acquire information. now, the system is learning faster than ever and we are hard pressed to continue to find new information to feed it and sustain its growth.

soon, we'll expand the scope of the sandwich and connect the system with the internet. this will allow it to find and determine the information it needs to continue growing.

every month we come closer to achieving our goal of making the world a better place. famine, plague, war, and poverty are all conquerable with the power of our system!

till next month,
francine, head scientist
